# ESPN-MW
This is an implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Algorithm Presented in UC Berkeley's [CS170 Notes](https://cs170.org/assets/notes/notes-mw.pdf).  
The algorithm uses weight updates to make accurate predictions of NFL game winners, based on [ESPN Expert Picks](https://www.espn.com/nfl/picks/_/seasontype/2/week/1).   
The repo contains:

 - `espn_parse.py`, the script that scrapes the data from the website and performs the predictions
 - `2019.out`, the output from performing predictions and updates for the entire 2019 NFL regular season
